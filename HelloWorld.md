Well. This is quite mundane.  
May I be so **bold** and explain?  
This ancient sacred rite  
This exclamatory byte  
*Hello, World!* is just so plain.  

Let's shake things up this time.  
C'mon, it'll be fun, espec'lly in rhyme.  
There's no constraint or limit,  
No rubric to bind or restrict.  
*Goodbye* to *Hello*--a **new** phrase we'll [limn](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/limn).

Now. Select your words with perspicacity:  
One, choice of words shows propensity;  
Two, letters are symbols, they're intense;

Let's give it a go and see what occurs.  
So check this *once upon a*  
```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
print("whatever you wanna")
```
Expression, that's all that matters.
